```{r}
#2. calculate the value of a whale death
#4% risk reduction is for one whale -- use the linear regression to calculate the change in predicted bidi when risk is reduced by 4% (the model is linear so can take this from any two points on the model, all else the same?)

#store coefficients as variables
intercept <- yeslm$coefficients[1]
risk <- yeslm$coefficients[2]

#the equation of the model
y= intercept + x1*risk + x2 *bid + x3*nep +x4*income1pct + x5*poor + x6*rich + x7* veryrich + x6*to50 +x7*to40 +x8*to60 +x9*to30

# default levels are income: middle, age category: over 60

# need to solve for x3!

x3= (y-  intercept + x1*risk + x2 *bid +x4*income1pct + x5*poor + x6*rich + x7* veryrich + x6*to50 +x7*to40 +x8*to60 +x9*to30)/nep

### no idea how to do this in R!
